## 📝 Progress & Reflections

_Use this section to journal your takeaways and lessons learned as you complete each module._

- **Day 1**: Set up repo, cloned locally, started Module 1. Realized I needed a deeper refresher on slicing and comprehensions.
- **Day 2**: Finished NumPy — loved re-learning broadcasting!
